# Haley's Personal Project

## Hockey Team Application:


A **hockey team application**. Enter statistics for players and teams and view who is qualified
for the NHL and determine how they are doing. Possible features include visual team and player leaderboards.
This application may be used by hardcore hockey fans, including me and my dad! Canada's national winter sport
*definitely* deserves a handy UI to catch up with your favourite hockey teams and players.
